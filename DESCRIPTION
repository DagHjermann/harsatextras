Description: This package adds some functions that enables one to perform assessment using the HARSAT package within the framework of a targets workflow. Specifically, it enables the user to add 'static branching', so if a small part of the dataset changes, assessment needs to be re-run for only relatively few time series, thus, saving time. Also, it contains a function for extracting the assessment results so they can be plotted using, e.g., ggplot2.
